# Traffic-Light-Controller-
In this project, we designed a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog that implements a Finite State Machine (FSM). The controller is efficiently designed to handle different traffic conditions. The project also includes a testbench and supports VCD waveform generation for simulation using EDA Playground.

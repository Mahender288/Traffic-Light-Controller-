# Traffic-Light-Controller-
In this project, we designed a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog that implements a Finite State Machine (FSM). The controller is efficiently designed to handle different traffic conditions. The project also includes a testbench and supports VCD waveform generation for simulation using EDA Playground.

 Project Overview
This project implements a **smart traffic light controller** using Verilog HDL.  
It handles **normal traffic flow** as well as **emergency vehicle priority**â€”the signals automatically shift to clear the emergency path.  

## Features
- Verilog-based traffic light controller
- Emergency signal detection and priority handling
- Testbench developed for functional verification
- Simulated and verified in **EDA Playground**
